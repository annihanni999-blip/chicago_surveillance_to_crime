# chicago_surveillance_to_crime
A comparative data analysis project exploring how large-scale surveillance networks relate to crime trends in Chicago and New York City. I collected, cleaned, and merged 15+ years of crime, population, CCTV, police presence, and socioeconomic data from open APIs (Socrata), OpenStreetMap, and city-level datasets to build a multi-city panel.
