# chicago_surveillance_to_crime
A comparative data analysis project exploring how large-scale surveillance networks relate to crime trends in Chicago and New York City. I collected, cleaned, and merged 15+ years of crime, population, CCTV, police presence, and socioeconomic data from open APIs (Socrata), OpenStreetMap, and city-level datasets to build a multi-city panel.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data collection from public APIs  
- ETL (cleaning, merging, creating a multi-city panel dataset)  
- Trend analysis & visualization  
- Working with geospatial-adjacent OSM data  
- Reproducible notebook workflow

## Key Finding 
Chicago expanded CCTV coverage several times since 2006, and crime per 100k declined significantly during the same period — with important socioeconomic caveats.
